              No issues, if you have no prior knowledge of coding you just need
              a strong will to master programming. First of all, pick a
              programming language (C++, Java, Python -recommended) learn its
              syntax and then dive into learning DSA (Data Structure and
              Algorithm) using that language and practice your skills on various
              platforms such as Hackerrank,HackerEarth.

              Web Development basically involves the development of front-end
              and back-end. In front-end development, we develop the user-end of
              the website. For front-end you should learn HTML,CSS and
              Javascript. You should first start with front-end development.
              After having a good command on HTML and CSS, you should learn
              Javascript basics(For simple front-end development basics of JS is
              enough). After the front-end, comes the backend. In the backend
              you should first learn about servers, databases and how the
              internet works? After that pick up a language (any one) such as
              Python (Django/Flask) preferable if you want to increase your
              tech-stack, You can also prefer Node.js as you have already learnt
              about JS in the front-end, you don’t have to learn something new.
              Learn Database languages like SQL and MongoDB (learn both). After
              that, you should learn any javascript framework which is in great
              demand like ReactJS. Also, keep in mind that each year, lots of
              new things come in this field, so be prepared with old
              technologies. The new ones are basically the modified forms of the
              old ones. For learning all these, you can refer to W3Schools, MDN
              WebDocs, Udemy, YouTube or the official documentation of the
              language.

              Graphic Design is a broad field with various niches. You will need
              to figure out your niche and proceed, which will ultimately come
              along with experience. First of all grab a decent level laptop and
              try installing Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, and look for some
              courses for Graphic Design on Udemy (Although they are paid but
              you can get them for free on torrent). Complete the course and
              parallelly keep exploring about Graphic Design on the internet,
              particularly on YouTube. (Some recommended channels: The Futur,
              GFX Mentor) Follow the above steps, you'll gradually get to know
              how to proceed further in the world of Media and Graphics. Hope it
              helps! PS: You can feel free to contact any of your seniors if you
              face issue in any of the above mentioned steps.

              You can start game development using any language but a game
              engine is preferred as it make everything easy and manageable,
              Unity(C#),Godot(C++,GDScript,C#) or Unreal Engine(C++). In HnCC we
              use Unity as it is good for beginners and small developers.
              YouTube has tons of tutorials regarding Unity Game Development and
              Unity itself has Demo Games and Tutorials for learning for free on
              their website. A mid or high core cpu is recommended and if you
              are thinking of creating a high graphics intensive game you must
              have a dedicated graphic card.

              AI or artificial intelligence simply means human intelligence
              exhibited by machines. Machine Learning is a subset of AI,it is an
              algorithm that has the capability to learn from its previous
              experiences and for that we don’t have to program it separatel
              First thing is to get familiar with the terms that we use in ML
              like features,training etc, secondly we have to understand the use
              of tools like jupyter notebook,pandas,numpy etc.then learn about
              the common ML models like linear regression,decision trees etc and
              the maths behind them.’ You can start your journey with the
              youtube channel “Code with Harry”. In short , ML is one small step
              towards data science. Start your journey with this small
              initiative.

              How would you sort a list that has a billion names on it in
              minimum time? How would you find the shortest route between two
              towns in a dense city? How would scientists find a bad gene in the
              DNA strand of billions of genes? These are some problems that have
              a huge data set to work on. So to solve these in a reasonable
              amount of time, one has to come with creative ideas to minimize
              the time and resources required to solve this on a computer. Data
              Structures and Algorithms is the study of these common problems.
              You’ll learn how to solve these kinds of huge problems.

              4 letters big!!! Just kidding. In terms of a team, we are being
              led by our Prof-in-Charge Dr. Dinesh Prabhakar Sir along with
              students from all the years. The final year members
              bepost-bearersors and the third year are the post bearers of the
              club. Generally, each year consists of 15-20 members, it can be
              more or less. So we have a great family of developers and coders
              proficient in various fields.

              From Wikipedia, Open-source software is a type of computer

              For us, it is a great chance to work in real work experience from
              great project maintainers in the world and contribute to software

              Short Answer:- Linux is the best operating system for developers
              or programmers. Long Answer:- HnCC Members will always suggest you
              go for the open-source operating system Linux. Linux powers the
              internet, system administrators, Supercomputers etc. For most apps
              or websites that you use, there is a high probability that it
              might have been powered by a Linux system. For a student, learning
              is the most important. Closed systems like Windows and Mac don’t
              provide that degree of open environment and hackable features like
              you get on a Linux system which is important for learning and
              experimenting. You can read more about the experience of having
              Linux OS, on the blog written by one of our 2nd-year member,
